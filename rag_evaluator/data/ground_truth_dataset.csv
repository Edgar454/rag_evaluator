Symptoms and Diagnosis\n\nThose bushes that are infected at the collar start to show general yellowing of the entire foliage: These symptoms become heightened with the onset of rains when they fail to recover; compared to an adjacent healthy bush. Upon uprooting, such plants will show near complete or complete girdling at the collar, depending on the intensity of yellowing: This could give the impression that the disease starts with the rains.\n\nInfection takes place through leaf scars, wounds or directly by penetration of the bark in plants; which have a shallow rooting habit; or in plants growing in unsuitable soils. Similarly, poorly developed nursery plants having weak root systems are also prone to attack. Infections over a large area is uncommon unless the area has poor, gravelly or clayey soil with underlying slab rock or unless very susceptible tea cultivars are used. Infections are usually sporadic and occasional, and patchy infections are a rarity: thinning of branches. Flowering and fruiting are common on infected bushes. Irregular canker is found at the collar region. Cankers caused by F. solani species complex cause premature leaf yellowing and leaf fall followed by older cankers having raised margin. Crakes and peeling off of the bark appear at the collar region at soil level or just below: The exposed cambium and wood were discolored giving a tan, brown or black color: Bushes die gradually.', b'# 3.1 Cultural Methods\n\nIt is important that the incidence of the disease should be kept to a minimum, up to the time of the first prune. Infection of the main stem and primary branches should be prevented if the plant is to survive and be productive in the coming years. To achieve this;', b'# STATEMENT OF MATTER IN DISPUTE\n\nThe matter in dispute between the aforesaid parties is whether the request made to amend the existing E3, E5 and E7 salary codes relevant for salaries given to electricians of Grade III, II, and I respectively as E4, E6 and E8 is just and equitable and whether the electricians have been caused injustice by the existing salaries and if so, to what relief, effective from which date are they entitled.\n\nB.K.

The Minimum Quality Standard based on ISO 3720, which is currently in force in Sri Lanka, be continued unchanged;\n2. The standard be applied at the point of export and not for domestic sales;\n3. The Board will set up the necessary mechanism to ensure that exporters adhere to the Minimum Standard in servicing export orders;\n4. The Minimum Standard panel consisting of representatives of the Tea Board, JEDB, SLSPC, TSHDA, Tea Brokers and the Tea Trade will continue to function to review appeals made by exporters relating to the Minimum Quality Standard;\n5. The Sri Lanka Tea Board may, in due course, take necessary regulations under its Act to ensure the enforcement of the Minimum Quality Standard for tea exports.\n\nThe Tea Board has also decided that ISO 3720 standard will continue as the standard for sales at Colombo Tea Auctions and that teas below this standard should not be catalogued for sale at the Auctions. However, producers would be permitted to sell any grade of tea below this standard through normal private sale procedures, such as blending or reclaiming to upgrade the good teas above the 3720 Standard.']"

However, their number and activity will depend on soil factors such as soil temperature, moisture, depth, use of agro-chemicals and organic matter etc. and plant factors such as age, cultivar and pruning cycle. Tea fields or nurseries may show symptoms caused by nematodes such as slow decline in growth, yellowing of leaves, premature flowering and fruiting and stunted growth etc. due to other stress factors such as drought, water deficit, clayeyness, hard pan and water logging conditions, nutrient imbalances etc. Before taking samples for nematode estimation, such factors should be ruled out. In order to assure a realistic nematode estimation, the sampling procedure should be different in a nursery and a field. Necessary sampling should be done to represent different cultivars, ages, conditions and symptoms of nematodes and weaknesses in plants of nursery or field. Nematode diagnosis is also proposed as an internal quarantine measure in assuring use of nematode free and healthy planting materials restricting dissemination of parasitic nematode species through planting materials in the tea growing areas.', b'# 20.

What types of tree species are recommended for establishing shelter belts in tea plantations in different regions?,"[b'# SHELTER BELT TREE SPECIES AND RECOMMENDED SPACING', b'# SQIs for different tea growing regions\n\nAccordingly, recommended SQIs for tea lands in different tea growing regions have been established, considering the aforesaid parameters of the rehabilitated fields and neighboring fields earmarked for up-rooting, as given in Table 2.', b'# 3. Integrated Management of Nematodes in Young Tea\n\nPlant parasitic nematodes affecting tea could be disseminated through planting materials, soil, water and agricultural implements etc. In the presence of a susceptible root system of a good host, the residual nematode populations may get developed. Hence, nematodes once introduced to fields, they cannot be eradicated. Further, all tea growing areas are declared as nematode active or prone areas due to evidences on presence of either of the above three species. Therefore, every attempt should be taken for integrated management of nematodes by adhering to the following measures in young tea:\n\n- a. The area should be planted to rehabilitation grasses; Mana or Guatemala for a minimum period of 2 years. Mana is recommended to all tea growing areas. In areas where the tea has been found to be infested with the burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, Guatemala grass is not recommended as it is a good host. The C03 (Hybrid Napier grass- Pennisetum purpureum X P. minimum of americarnum) grass is recommended for lands with no months of rehabilitation as the biomass production is comparatively high (Please refer to Advisory Circular PM 12).\n- b. Use of nematode free and healthy planting materials of recommended cultivars to the region for field planting (please refer to Advisory Circulars PN 1 on Suitability of Tea Clones for the Different Regions and PN 2 on Good Nursery Management Practices).\n- c. Adopt all Good Agricultural Practices (GAPs) recommended by TRI to ascertain healthy and vigorous plant growth.\n- d. Prophylactic chemical treatments to bring down any residual plant parasitic nematode populations ensuring to avoid invasion to tea roots of the newly introduced tea plants as described under section 4.', b'# Region-specific species', b'# 1. Introduction\n\nDiseases, insect, mite and nematode pests and weeds occur in tea, in different stages of the crop, and at different times of the year. Therefore an integrated approach (Integrated Pest Management: IPM) is recommended for efficient and timely management of pests in tea, which consists of various agronomic, cultural, biological and chemical strategies in a rational and environmentally friendly manner: Rational use of fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, and weedicides is part of integrated management of diseases; insects, mites, nematodes and weeds respectively.\n\nIn parallel, it is necessary to strengthen biological systems and improve cultural practices in order to promote the build-up of tolerance in plant and biological-control organisms in the environment; and to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests, diseases and weeds in tea fields. Also, use of tea cultivars resistant / tolerant to the different diseases and pests is the prime component in the IPM:\n\nAs tea is a food commodity for human consumption, there is a growing concern among health-conscious consumers on pesticide residues that may be present in tea. Therefore, it is advisable to use pesticides in tea fields carefully, in order to minimize the residues in made tea, effects on workers and non-target organisms in the eco-system: Moreover; the cost-effectiveness and the social acceptance of pesticide usage also have to be considered for the sustainability of the tea industry:\n\nThe chemicals and their use in tea as Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are subjected to change periodically to meet the requirements of consumers, social and environmental acceptance etc. It is extremely necessary to ensure that the pesticide residues in made tea at levels below the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) set for different pesticides by different countries.\n\nWhen PPPs are applied to tea cultivations, it is necessary to strictly adhere to specific Pre-Harvest Intervals (PHI) and bulk green leaf from the sprayed and unsprayed fields or made tea at a ratio of keeping and monitoring on rational use of the PPPs are made mandatory for traceability and regulatory purposes: This would help dilute and minimize the pesticide residues in the made tea. Proper record keeping is essential.']"

Its damage to cultivated crops has become frequent in the recent past and tea is no exception. Most of the tea growing regions in Sri Lanka receive rains from both north-east and south-west monsoons. However, tea plantations are adversely affected by moisture stress conditions due to uneven distribution of rainfall within the year. The main dry period in most of the tea growing regions extends from early January to about late March. However, those areas which receive mainly the north-east monsoon rains, viz. Uva and some parts of the Low and Mid country, have the rain dry period generally extending from late June to about early September.\n\nDuring these dry months, considerable damage can be caused to both young and mature tea, with extensive casualties being observed in young clonal tea during their first and the second year after planting. In order to minimize such damage and ensure early recovery, the following precautionary measures need to be adopted prior to, and following, a drought. The drought effects differ with the growth stage of tea, that is whether it is young tea (before first pruning) or mature tea (after first pruning). Hence drought mitigation measures also should vary according to the stage of growth of the tea.', b'# 1.0 Introduction\n\nTwo nursery mixtures, viz. T65 MAP (containing mono-ammonium phosphate) and T65 DAP (containing di-ammonium phosphate), are recommended differing only in the source of phosphate. The option to have two P fertiliser sources is to allow the grower to use either source depending on its availability in the market. When both mixtures are available, T65 MAP is preferred as it is easier to handle because it dissolves faster.']"

"How often should fertilizer be applied to tea fields, and what are the recommended dosages?","[b'# 11.2 Fertilizer applications\n\nFertilizer should be applied only after the cuttings have been rooted, which would be between six to eight weeks in the Low country and ten to twelve weeks in the Up country. Please refer Advisory Circular No. SP 1 for details of fertilizer application.', b'# 5. Advantages of Categorization\n\nThe main benefit is the prioritization of funds into productive fields, particularly when funds are limited, to obtain maximum returns from limited resources. When fertilizer is in short supply, or curtailment of expenditure is necessitated due to budgetary constraints, we could optimize inputs in better fields to attain maximum benefits, and restrict them to the restriction of inputs, priorities could also be more clearly laid down for efficient and relatively poor fields rather than impose a standard cut all round: In a manner similar to cost-effective worker utilization for various cultural operations.\n\nCategorization is most useful in maintaining the estate production uniformly from one year to other: In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to prune equal extents in cycle, one would prune a fourth of each category: For replanting, a long term program could be prepared to replace the tea in fields at the ""C"" category, where there are no major limitations. A critical examination must be undertaken on each selected field to determine the cause for low yields. Replanting should be considered only if soil conditions are suitable, without much erosion.\n\nIt is only natural that there are deaths in tea fields from time to time and if not replaced, a regular program of infilling, then productivity of such fields will decline steadily: Infilling should commence with the ""A"" category fields, consisting of all VP tea and the best seedling tea, and thereafter the better ""B"" category fields. The poorer ""B"" category fields as soil conditions may be too poor for good growth of infills. Infilling generally would not be desirable in lower ""C"" category fields.', b'# 8. Aftercare\n\nThe infills should be protected by pegging, or with a small basket so that workers do not trample the plants while doing other cultural operations. Bringing into bearing should be practiced at the correct time. The side branches of adjacent bushes should be cut in order to permit sufficient light to reach the young supplies. Fertilizer should be applied as for young VP tea plants. Avoid use of herbicides in filled patches up to the first prune. The area should be kept weed free and thatched with an organic mulch.\n\nThe Tea Research Institute of Sri Lanka\n\nTalawakelle\n\n\nAll rights reserved.
