What are the recommended soil amendments for termite-infested tea lands and how should they be applied?,"[b'# 1.2 Importance of Replanting Nematode Infested Areas in Integrated Nematode Management\n\nReplanting is considered an important agronomic operation which replaces unproductive, old, nematode and other soil pathogen infested tea lands or sections as well as fields with stress factors limiting growth and productivity of tea. In this context; the aims of replanting are therefore to correct the limiting factors in the land for a sustainable, productive and cost effective newly established crop.\n\nProper soil sampling for nematode infestation should be carried out in unproductive immature or mature tea fields and prior to uprooting as per instructions given in the Advisory Circular PM 5. If nematode infestation has been ruled out as the main stress factor or leading to soil sickness in an area, the following steps should be rigidly followed during the replanting process. In the whole process of replanting, removal of plant and field limiting attributes, preparation of land, selection of appropriate sources of planting materials to suit to new planting should be given due consideration.', b'# Fertilizer Recommendation for Mature Tea in Small Holdings\n\nThis circular replaces Interim Circular No. SP 10, Serial No: 01/10, issued in August 2010.\n\nThe soil organic matter content in low and mid country and Uva tea growing regions are generally low and therefore, the potential of retaining plant nutrients in these soils is also relatively low. This leads to poor use efficiency of soil applied fertilizers in these regions. Recent assessments done in small holder lands in these regions revealed that soil magnesium (Mg) and sulphur (S) levels are also significantly low.\n\nApplications of mixed fertilizers containing nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) as Urea, Eppawela rock phosphate and Muriate of potash respectively, are recommended for mature tea fields in 2 to 5 splits per annum. The annual requirement of N is based on the potential yield recommended quantity of dolomite (MgCO3CaCO3) for pH correction at the time of pruning: The recommended quantity of dolomite is to be based on soil pH level in the latter part of the last year of cycle. Dolomite should comply with the specifications given in the TRI Advisory Circular SP3.\n\nEven though dolomite is applied, low nutrient retention capacities of soils may not make Mg available for plants throughout the pruning cycle. Furthermore, Mg deficiency could also be induced due to suppression of its uptake by the applications of higher rates of N and K containing fertilizers. These circumstances invariably lead to lack of Mg in soil and affecting healthy plant growth.\n\nIn view of above observations, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 were formulated as strategic interventions to improve soil fertility status in the tea small holdings. The suitability of new mixtures were tested in 26 small holder lands along with the other fertilizer mixtures previously recommended by the TRI, covering different Agro-ecological regions in major tea growing areas.\n\nBased on the outcomes of adaptive trials, two new fertilizer mixtures viz. U834 and UT752 are recommended for small holdings in all the tea growing regions in addition to previously recommended fertilizer mixtures for mature VP tea fields in different tea growing regions viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VPIUM 910 and VPIUM 1020 for mid & up country and VPIUva 945 and VPIUva 1055 for the Uva region.\n\n|Fertilizer Mixtures|Tea Growing Regions|\n|---|---|\n|U834|All Regions|\n|UT752|All Regions|\n|VPILC 880|Low Country|\n|VPILC 1075|Low Country|\n|VPIUM 910|Mid & Up Country|\n|VPIUM 1020|Mid & Up Country|\n|VPIUva 945|Uva Region|\n|VPIUva 1055|Uva Region|\nGrowers may select the mixtures to be used primarily based on the soil nutrient status, yield or crop responses. It is advisable to use either UT 752 mixture with 100 kg of dolomite per acre per annum or U 834 mixture if soil Mg and/or S levels are below 60 and 40 milligrams per kilogram (ppm) respectively in all the tea growing regions. However, if soil Mg level is above 60 ppm and S level above 40 ppm, it is appropriate to use regional specific mixtures viz. VPILC 880 and VPILC 1075 for low country, VP/UM 910 and VPMUM 1020 for mid and up country and VPUva 945 and VPMUva 1055 for Uva region.', b'# 2.3 Rehabilitation of Lands Using Grasses\n\nRehabilitation of nematode infested tea fields and or the area block identified for infilling process with a non-host plant species is a pre-requisite in all tea growing areas in view of imposing a long break for not allowing the nematode to survive and multiply further: Improvement of soil biological, chemical and physical characters conducive for the new crop is also envisaged through acceleration of organic matter status, structure, neutralize allelopathic effects of long-term cultivation of tea, break down residues of agro chemicals, pesticides, fertilizers etc. Resultantly, development and multiplication of densities of inherent natural enemies of nematodes such as bacteria, fungi, micro arthropods, free living and saprophytic nematode species are favored.\n\nThe nematode infested areas identified by the TRI be planted with Mana or Guatemala for an extended rehabilitation period as recommended by the TRI: Mana is recommended to all tea growing areas: In areas where the tea has been found to be infested with the burrowing nematode, Radopholus similis, Guatemala grass is not recommended as it is a good host.\n\nC03 (Hybrid Napier grass Pennisetum perpureum X P. americarnum) grass is recommended for lands with no nematode history and for a minimum of 12 months of rehabilitation as the biomass production is comparatively high (Please refer TRI Guideline 02/2018 issued in December 2018). The grass rehabilitated areas should be maintained by regular lopping along with recommended inputs; fertilizers etc. (Please refer to Advisory Circular SP 6 for application rates). The grass should be cut periodically before flowering and incorporated into the land to improve the organic matter levels.', b'# Introduction\n\nSoil rehabilitation by planting recommended grasses; Guatemala (Tripsacum laxum) or Mana (Cymbopogon confertiflorus) and maintaining for a minimum of 18 months, prior to replanting is a recommended practice in tea cultivation. Long term experimental evidence reveals replanting, with soil rehabilitation is economically viable and replanting without rehabilitation would lead to productivity decline in most tea lands including the smallholdings. However, there has been a concern in the smallholdings sector as to the long gestation of 18\xe2\x80\x9324 months for soil rehabilitation. It has also been evident that some arable lands are sufficiently fertile so that they could be replanted without soil rehabilitation. The above circumstances together with unavailability of adequate extent of lands amongst small holders for replanting, has prompted the Tea Research Institute to carry out investigations to introduce alternative approaches for decision making in soil rehabilitation prior to replanting.', b'# UPROOTING, REHABILITATION AND REPLANTING OF NEMATODE INFESTED TEA LANDS\n\nThis Advisory Circular supersedes Advisory Circular No. N 4 issued in August 1990)']"

"How can tea farmers effectively manage weeds in their fields, and what are the benefits and drawbacks of using chemical herbicides as part of an Integrated Weed Management (IWM) approach?","[b'# 3 Integrated Weed Management Methods\n\nWeed management in tea lands has to be achieved in an integrated manner. The various practices adopted include manual, mechanical, chemical, cultural, ecological and biological methods. Amongst preventive measures, the following methods are very important as their adoption could help to minimize the cost of weeding:\n\nIntegrated Weed Management (IWM) refers to a combination of some or all the above methods in a rotational manner throughout the year. IWM utilizes the available know-how on weeds and their management to achieve cost-effective and eco-friendly weed control (Figure 1).', b""# CHEMICAL CONTROL OF WEEDS IN TEA LANDS\n\n'This Advisory Circular supersedes the Advisory Circular PU 3, Serial No. 03/23 issued in May 2023 and previous related circulars and links with Circular No. WMI, Serial No.24/24 issued in February 2024)\n\nIntegrated Weed Management (IWM) approach includes manual, mechanical, cultural and chemical methods (in rotation) as specified in TRI Advisory Circular WM 1. The use of herbicides has some advantages, such as selectivity and cost-effectiveness, but sometimes causes crop damages, residue issues and environmental problems that need to be avoided by limiting the number of applications to two rounds per annum and strictly adhering to the recommended rate. When using herbicides, the TRI recommendations should always be followed along with a minimum of one week Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI). Precautions should also be taken to avoid spray drift onto the tea foliage and green stems."", b'# 3.4 Cultural Ecological Weed Control Methods\n\nThe objective of adopting cultural ecological techniques is to enable quick establishment of proper ground cover of land, to suppress the growth of weeds. This could be achieved by adoption of following practices:\n\n- Infilling vacant patches in tea fields with quick growing, early spreading cultivars that would attain a quick ground cover and thereby shade out the weeds. In old tea fields, where the vacancies are not expected to be infilled in near future, a suitable grass such as Mana (Cymbopogon confertiflorus), Guatemala (Tripsicum laxum), Hybrid napier CO-3 (Pennisetum perpureum X Pennisetum americarnum) or Vetiver (Chrysopogon zizanioides) grass may be planted to avoid such vacant patches becoming breeding grounds for weeds. These grasses will suppress weeds due to their smothering and allelopathic effects.\n- Planting of green manure crops, such as Crotalaria micans (Adanahiriya), Tithonia diversifolia (wild sun flower), Wild chrysanthemum Mari Kolondu (Artemisa vulgaris) or Flemingia macrophylla in vacant patches and as a hedge row for thatching in tea fields is also useful. Cover crops such as Mal ratakaju (Arachis pintoi) could also be planted on two feet wide strips in middle of the tea inter rows and Eth undupiyalaiya (Grona ovalifolia) and Indigofera sp. in non-tea areas such as roadsides, borders, abandoned lands etc.\n- Using suitable mulching materials such as Mana, Guatemala, Godapara (Dillenia suffruticosa), Flemingia macrophylla etc.; artificial agriculture mulch could be used to cover the inter-row spaces as effective mulching sources.\n- Adoption of all possible measures to encourage the early development of frames in the tea bush maintaining bush stand is essential in minimizing the potentials of weed emergence. This could be achieved using healthy and well spreading nursery plants in new clearings, proper infilling programs, adoption of Good Agricultural Practices ensuring implementation of timely bringing-into-bearing to enhance spread of peripheral branches of the bush.', b'# 3.5 Manual Weeding\n\nManual weeding could be undertaken either by exclusively ""hand-pulling"" weeds or by ""slash weeding"", as described below:\n\nHand pulling is the removal of weeds totally by hand. Although a costly operation, it is a safer method than chemical weeding:\n\nClean weeding by using a scraper should be strongly discouraged. Selective weeding should be advocated, where shallow rooted soft herbs such as *Centella asiatica (Gotukola), Drymaria cordata (Kadalai kodi), Grona triflora (Heen undupiyaliya), Euphorbia scordiifolia (Heendada keeriya), Oxalis sp. (Ambul ambiliya), Stemodia verticillata, Mollugo pentaphylla* etc. which are beneficial are retained to serve as a live ground cover:\n\nDigging the soil to remove tuberous or rhizomatous weeds is not advocated because such practice could aggravate weed infestation arising through regrowth of fragmented underground plant parts that are capable of regeneration:\n\nWeeds that are resistant to herbicides should be hand pulled, along with other free-growing weeds. All creeping weeds such as *Anredera cordifolia (Passali kodi), Camonea pilosa (Maha-MadulKiri-madu-vael), Ipomoea sp. (Railway glory/ Morning glory), Mikania sp. (Watupalu/Lokapalu), Neustanthus phaseoloides (Pohora-wel), Xenostegia tridentata* (Heen madu wel) etc. should be removed manually:\n\nAll the weeds that are removed from a tea field should be piled up in a wooden cage within the tea block. It is necessary to mix up the heap once in a while, to check and remove re-growing tuberous rhizomatous weeds: Weeds should be used for composting only after picking out the yams, bulbils and other vegetative parts capable of regeneration, and destroying them.', b'# 2.10\n\nAdhere to integrated weed management strategies as per TRI guidelines to ensure higher yield.

What are the most suitable green manure crop species for different elevations and agro-ecological zones in tea-growing regions?,"[b'# DROUGHT MITIGATION IN TEA PLANTATIONS\n\n(This circular cancels the circular No. PA 2 serial No. 2/01 issued in January 2001)\n\nDrought is a serious environmental hazard. Its damage to cultivated crops has become frequent in the recent past and tea is no exception. Most of the tea growing regions in Sri Lanka receive rains from both north-east and south-west monsoons. However, tea plantations are adversely affected by moisture stress conditions due to uneven distribution of rainfall within the year. The main dry period in most of the tea growing regions extends from early January to about late March. However, those areas which receive mainly the north-east monsoon rains, viz. Uva and some parts of the Low and Mid country, have the rain dry period generally extending from late June to about early September.\n\nDuring these dry months, considerable damage can be caused to both young and mature tea, with extensive casualties being observed in young clonal tea during their first and the second year after planting. In order to minimize such damage and ensure early recovery, the following precautionary measures need to be adopted prior to, and following, a drought. The drought effects differ with the growth stage of tea, that is whether it is young tea (before first pruning) or mature tea (after first pruning). Hence drought mitigation measures also should vary according to the stage of growth of the tea.', b'# Climatic and soil requirements for CO-3 grass\n\nThe CO-3 grass grows well in high rainfall areas (in excess of 1500 mm per year) and under full sunlight. The optimum temperature range for its growth is 25 \xe2\x80\x93 40oC. The CO-3 grass is very susceptible to frost. Hence, it is not suitable for tea growing regions at high elevations especially above 1500 m amsl. Water logging and very acidic soil conditions are also not conducive for growth of CO-3 grass.', b'# Shade tree species and planting distances recommended for the different tea growing regions', b'# 3.3\n\nSesbania sesban is also recommended as a green manure crop for all elevations.

Use well grown healthy plants and not what is left over in the nursery after planting the clearings: The planting of cuttings should be advanced to have plants ready in the planting season. Use around 15 month-old plants in the Up-country, 12-month old plants in the Mid-country and 9-month old plants at low elevations. The planting of the cuttings should be accordingly advanced to have the plants ready in the planting season.', b'# Plant Response to ground applied nutrients\n\nThe optimum range of N; P and K nutrients (kg/ha/yr) required by seedling and VP teas for maximum yield response in different tea growing regions are given in Table 1.', b'# Introduction\n\nImmature tea plants require generous fertiliser applications in the early stages of growth: Although immature plants are capable of rapid development, their root systems are small and occupy only a small soil volume from which the nutrients can be absorbed: An adequate supply of the necessary nutrients should, therefore, be made available for best results.\n\nFertilizer mixture T200 is recommended for immature tea from field planting to the commencement of plucking: A separate fertiliser mixture, T750, with a higher proportion of nitrogen is recommended from commencement of plucking to the first prune: Special attention should be given to the methods and frequency of application. The amelioration of soil pH with dolomitic limestone is also an important operation during the immature phase.']"

Symptoms and Diagnosis\n\nThose bushes that are infected at the collar start to show general yellowing of the entire foliage: These symptoms become heightened with the onset of rains when they fail to recover; compared to an adjacent healthy bush. Upon uprooting, such plants will show near complete or complete girdling at the collar, depending on the intensity of yellowing: This could give the impression that the disease starts with the rains.\n\nInfection takes place through leaf scars, wounds or directly by penetration of the bark in plants; which have a shallow rooting habit; or in plants growing in unsuitable soils. Similarly, poorly developed nursery plants having weak root systems are also prone to attack. Infections over a large area is uncommon unless the area has poor, gravelly or clayey soil with underlying slab rock or unless very susceptible tea cultivars are used. Infections are usually sporadic and occasional, and patchy infections are a rarity: thinning of branches. Flowering and fruiting are common on infected bushes. Irregular canker is found at the collar region. Cankers caused by F. solani species complex cause premature leaf yellowing and leaf fall followed by older cankers having raised margin. Crakes and peeling off of the bark appear at the collar region at soil level or just below: The exposed cambium and wood were discolored giving a tan, brown or black color: Bushes die gradually.', b'# 3.1 Cultural Methods\n\nIt is important that the incidence of the disease should be kept to a minimum, up to the time of the first prune.

What are the main conditions to get a subsidy for replanting tea bushes? What are the main stages of releasing funds for the Green leaf owners?,"[b'# 1. Leaf sampling\n\nFor most leaf analysis, it is the first mature leaf (Figure 1) that is collected and it is from the axil of this leaf that the pluckable shoot emerges. This is usually found on the plucking table, whilst those below; and consequently shaded should be avoided. When sampling an experimental plot; one or two leaves are taken from each bush in the plot to provide a composite sample of about 100 leaves.\n\n1. When sampling is carried out on field scale, a large number of widely distributed bushes should be sampled, taking one leaf from each bush.\n2. In order to get a representative sample; it is preferable to randomly select bushes from different rows.\n3. Bushes growing in abnormal areas such as close to roads and drains and those in bare patches should be avoided.\n4. It is best to avoid collecting leaf samples following a period of prolonged heavy rainfall or during extreme droughts.', b'# 2. Symptoms\n\nHorse-hair Blight originates either from the main stem or any of the branches and the fungal strands grow upwards, with the help of small brown pads of hyphal aggregates, crisscrossing the entire bush: netting, in which all the debris and falling leaves are entrapped. The fungus usually obtains its nourishment from the dead outer bark of the older tea stems as well as from the decaying material within its entangle. This results in a matrix of debris. The problem assumes greater dimensions towards the latter stages of the pruning cycle, giving the bush a very unhygienic appearance. Heavily affected bushes would generally appear to be unthrifty.', b'# 2\n\nThere shall be paid out of the Fund-\n\n- (a) such amounts as are authorized by regulation to be paid as subsidies under a scheme for subsidizing the replanting of tea estates and tea small holdings or a scheme for subsidising the rehabilitation of tea estates and tea small holdings;\n- (b) such amounts as are authorized by regulation to be paid as subsidies under a scheme for subsidizing the replanting of rubber estates and rubber small holdings;\n- (c) such amounts as are authorized by regulation to be paid under a scheme for subsidizing the marketing of green tea leaf of tea estates and tea small holdings or a scheme for subsidizing the manufacture of made tea from such green tea leaf;\n- (d) the expenses incurred in connection with the establishment by the Government of nurseries for the supply of high grade planting material to proprietors of tea estates, rubber estates, tea small holdings or rubber small holdings, or in connection with the supply of fertilizers to such proprietors;\n- (e) such remuneration as may be payable to members of the Tea Subsidy Advisory Board established under this Act;\n- (f) the prescribed contributions to any provident fund or scheme established for the payment of gratuities or such sums to the Consolidated Fund for the payment of pension to all or any of the officers and servants employed for the purposes of this Act and their dependants;

What are the specific Pre-Harvest Intervals (PHI) and record-keeping requirements for the use of Plant Protection Products (PPPs) in tea cultivations to ensure traceability and regulatory compliance?,"[b'# 1. Introduction\n\nDiseases, insect, mite and nematode pests and weeds occur in tea, in different stages of the crop, and at different times of the year. Therefore an integrated approach (Integrated Pest Management: IPM) is recommended for efficient and timely management of pests in tea, which consists of various agronomic, cultural, biological and chemical strategies in a rational and environmentally friendly manner: Rational use of fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, and weedicides is part of integrated management of diseases; insects, mites, nematodes and weeds respectively.\n\nIn parallel, it is necessary to strengthen biological systems and improve cultural practices in order to promote the build-up of tolerance in plant and biological-control organisms in the environment; and to prevent the introduction and dissemination of pests, diseases and weeds in tea fields. Also, use of tea cultivars resistant / tolerant to the different diseases and pests is the prime component in the IPM:\n\nAs tea is a food commodity for human consumption, there is a growing concern among health-conscious consumers on pesticide residues that may be present in tea. Therefore, it is advisable to use pesticides in tea fields carefully, in order to minimize the residues in made tea, effects on workers and non-target organisms in the eco-system: Moreover; the cost-effectiveness and the social acceptance of pesticide usage also have to be considered for the sustainability of the tea industry:\n\nThe chemicals and their use in tea as Plant Protection Products (PPPs) are subjected to change periodically to meet the requirements of consumers, social and environmental acceptance etc. It is extremely necessary to ensure that the pesticide residues in made tea at levels below the Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) set for different pesticides by different countries.\n\nWhen PPPs are applied to tea cultivations, it is necessary to strictly adhere to specific Pre-Harvest Intervals (PHI) and bulk green leaf from the sprayed and unsprayed fields or made tea at a ratio of keeping and monitoring on rational use of the PPPs are made mandatory for traceability and regulatory purposes: This would help dilute and minimize the pesticide residues in the made tea. Proper record keeping is essential.', b'# Replacement of the long title of Act No. 51 of 1957.\n\n2.
